    "A pet store sells a limited number of 20-gallon aquariums. At the end of each week, the store manager takes inventory and places orders. Store policy is to order three new 20-gallon aquariums at the end of the week if all the current inventory has been sold. If even one of the 20-gallon aquariums remains in stock, no new units are ordered. This policy is based on the observation that the store only sells an average of one of the 20-gallon aquariums per week. Is this policy adequate to guard against potential lost sales of 20-gallon aquariums due to a customer requesting one when they are out of stock?\n",

    "### Step 1: Ask a question\n",
    "\n",
    "Our question here is what is the probability that demand exceeds supply. In order to do this we must make some assumptions about the arrival of buyers who will purchase an aquarium if there is one in stock and the supply of aquariums at the beginning of any given week, which we define as $D_n$ and $S_n$, respectively. Our assumptions about the supply of aquariums have already been made by the store's current inventory policy, which we may or may not alter to improve profits. We assume that the probability distribution of the demand for aquariums is a poisson distribution centered at 1. A summary of step one is provided below.\n",

    "**Variables:**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$D_n =$ demand for aquariums during week $n$.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If $D_{n-1} < S_{n-1} - 1$, then $S_n = S_{n-1} - D_{n-1}$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Here we are considering the random variable $S_n$. We know that $S_n \\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$ because at the end of week $n-1$ there could potentially be $0$ or $1$ aquariums left ($S_{n-1} - D_{n-1} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$), which would mean $S_n \\in \\{3, 4\\}$, and otherwise we have $2$ or more aquariums left at the end of week; however, it it not possible to have more than $4$ aquariums in stock. Since we have assumed that $D_n$ is a poisson process centered at $1$, $S_n$ depends only on $S_{n-1}$. Thus, we can say that the sequence $\\{S_n\\}$ is a Markov chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not know the value of $S_0$, but it seems reasonable to make the assumption that $S_0 = 3$; however, we may adjust this assumption later on. \n",

    "\n",
    "First of all, the probability of transitioning between states is clearly dependent on the distribution of $D_n$. We compute relevant values of $D_n$ below."

    "For our sensitivity analysis we will not talk about seasonal trends or anything requiring the Markov model to depend on more than $S_{n-1}$. Like in Example $8.1$ we will examine the effect of varying the average number of potential buyers per week ($\\lambda$). To do this, I was kind of lazy. I simply reran the above code boxes, except I changed the definition of the probability distribution of $D_n$. That is, I changed the -1 to -.8, -.9, -1.1, and -1.2, and simply wrote down each of the values. The point with choosing numbers that are pretty close to 1 is that the store will probably not have huge changes in the average number of customers per week over time; however, it could be the case that the original problem had an unreasonable number for the number of potential customers per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up that the probability of excess demand as .0202, .0275, .0359, .0455, .0563 for when the probability distribution of $D_n$ is centered at the values .8, .9, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, respectively. More sophisticated measurements of sensitivity can be derived from these numbers, if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the probability of excess demand becomes very large $\\lambda$ values that might seem unreasonable. For example, if the store doubles it's potential customers ($\\lambda = 2$), then the probability of excess demand is .1774. Having $\\lambda$ double may seem unreasonable, but if there are seasonal trends, then this may very well be the case. That is, $\\lambda=1$ were based off of the average for the whole year, and the number of aquariums sold weekly in the summer is double that of the whole year, then during the summer we would have a large probability of excess demand."

However, having a reservoir is better than not having one at all, I suppose. Also, it may just be the case that the river frequently has less than $1000$ cfs, but that there is not necessarily a drought, meaning that most of the time, the reservoir is not needed, and that it functions as a way to reduce floods and reintroduce the water at a safe but also potentially beneficial point in time."
